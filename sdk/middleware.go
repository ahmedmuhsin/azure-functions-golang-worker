// Handler is the unit a Middleware wraps. It runs a single function invocation
// and returns nil on success or an error that becomes the failure status on
// the InvocationResponse.
//
// The MiddlewareContext passed in is the framework's per-invocation carrier.
// It embeds *InvocationContext so trigger-side fields (mc.InvocationID,
// mc.FunctionName, mc.TraceContext, etc.) are reachable directly via field
// promotion; middleware that only reads trigger data treats it like the
// user-facing InvocationContext. Middleware integration code (e.g.
// auto-harvested outbound trace attributes) uses the MC-specific methods on
// the same value.
//
// Note: Handler is the worker-internal function shape that middleware
// composes around. User-facing handler signatures (HTTPHandler, TimerHandler,
// etc.) remain unchanged; the dispatcher constructs the innermost Handler
// from the user's typed function via reflection.
type Handler func(ctx context.Context, mc *MiddlewareContext) error

// Middleware decorates a Handler with cross-cutting behavior such as
// distributed tracing, structured logging, exception capture, or short-circuit
// authorization.
//
// Wrap receives the next Handler in the chain and returns a new Handler that
// may run code before/after calling next, may transform ctx (for example, by
// attaching an OpenTelemetry span), or may short-circuit by returning without
// calling next.
//
// The interface shape (rather than a function type) is intentional: it lets
// implementations carry per-instance state (e.g. a TracerProvider, an
// authentication policy) and lets them participate in optional contracts such
// as [CapabilityProvider] without forcing every middleware to be the same
// concrete type. Plain function middleware can wrap itself in [MiddlewareFunc]
// to satisfy the interface — exactly the net/http Handler/HandlerFunc pattern.
type Middleware interface {
	// Wrap returns a Handler that decorates next.

// MiddlewareFunc adapts a plain function of the shape
// `func(next Handler) Handler` to the [Middleware] interface. Use it when
// no per-instance state is needed:
//
//	app.Use(sdk.MiddlewareFunc(func(next sdk.Handler) sdk.Handler {
//	    return func(ctx context.Context, mc *sdk.MiddlewareContext) error {
//	        log.Printf("invocation %s", mc.InvocationID)
//	        return next(ctx, mc)
//	    }
//	}))
//
// Mirrors the net/http Handler/HandlerFunc pairing.

// CapabilityProvider is an optional contract a [Middleware] can implement to
// advertise capability flags that a transport may relay to the Functions host.
//
// When a Middleware is registered via [App.Use], the App merges the returned
// map into [App.Capabilities]. How — and whether — those flags reach the host
// is transport-specific: the gRPC worker copies them into
// WorkerInitResponse.Capabilities during its startup handshake, while a
// transport without runtime capability negotiation (for example the custom
// handler, whose capabilities are declared statically in host.json) ignores
// them.
//
// The standard use case is a tracing middleware advertising
// "WorkerOpenTelemetryEnabled": "true" so a host that supports the flag knows
// the worker is emitting OTel telemetry directly and shouldn't double-emit to
// Application Insights for the same invocation.
//
// Implementations should return a stable, side-effect-free map. The App reads
// it once at registration time.

// ShutdownProvider is an optional contract a [Middleware] can implement when
// it owns asynchronous resources (TracerProviders, LoggerProviders, exporter
// batch processors, etc.) that need to be flushed and released when the
// worker process is shutting down.
//
// When a Middleware is registered via [App.Use], the App checks whether it
// satisfies ShutdownProvider; if so, the returned callback is appended to the
// App's shutdown list. The worker invokes those callbacks sequentially in
// registration order once the gRPC bidi stream closes (graceful host
// termination) or the process receives a SIGTERM/SIGINT.
//
// Callbacks should respect ctx (which the worker plumbs with a bounded
// timeout) and propagate any unrecoverable error so the worker can log it
// before exiting. Returning nil is the success path. Callbacks must be safe
// to invoke at most once.
//
// The intent is that user code does not need a defer cleanup() line in
// main(); the worker's lifecycle owns the shutdown sequence and middlewares
// own the resources they create.

// Use registers a [Middleware]. Middleware run in registration order: the
// first registered is the outermost — i.e. it observes the invocation first
// and last. This matches the convention used by net/http middleware libraries
// (chi, gin, echo), gRPC interceptors, and Go's broader ecosystem.
//
// If mw also implements [CapabilityProvider], its capability map is merged
// into the App's capability map at registration time. Later registrations
// overwrite earlier values for the same key; deterministic behavior is the
// registrant's responsibility.
//
// If mw also implements [ShutdownProvider], its Shutdown method is registered
// for invocation by the worker once the gRPC stream closes or the process
// receives a termination signal. Shutdowns run in registration order.
//
// Registering the same Middleware multiple times runs its Wrap multiple times.
// Use must be called before worker.Start; registering middleware after the
// worker has begun handling invocations is undefined and not safe for
// concurrent use.
//
// A nil mw is silently dropped, so callers can register conditional
// middleware without an explicit guard:
