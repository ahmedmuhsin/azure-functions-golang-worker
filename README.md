> Public preview. The features described here are available for preview use and may change before general availability.

The `azure-functions-golang-worker` repository provides the SDK and worker implementation to run Go (Golang) applications natively on Azure Functions. This allows developers to write serverless applications using familiar idiomatic Go structures, such as standard `net/http` handlers and structured types, while deeply integrating with Azure Function's bindings and trigger ecosystem.

## Features

* **Native Go Feel:** Use standard `http.ResponseWriter` and `*http.Request` for HTTP APIs.
* **Worker-driven Indexing:** No need to manually author `function.json` files. Define your triggers and bindings directly in Go code using a functional options API.
* **First-Class Performance:** Runs in an out-of-process model utilizing gRPC for highly performant bidirectional communication with the Azure Functions host.
* **Rich Bindings:** Built-in reflection to map Azure bindings (like blobs, queues, CosmosDB) into strictly typed Go pointers and structs.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/)
* [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-functions-core-tools/v/4.12.0) 4.12.0 or later (includes Go worker support)

```bash
# Install Azure Functions Core Tools
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true
```

### Writing Your First Function

Initialize a standard Go module for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-go-func
cd my-go-func
go mod init myapp
go get github.com/azure/azure-functions-golang-worker
go mod tidy
```

> **Use a tagged release.** We encourage pinning your project to a published, tagged release of the worker (e.g. `go get github.com/azure/azure-functions-golang-worker@v0.7.0`) rather than building against whatever is currently on `main`. Tagged releases are the versions we validate and support; `main` is an active development branch and may contain in-progress or breaking changes. To upgrade later, re-run `go get` with the newer tag. You can find the available versions on the [releases page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-golang-worker/releases).

Create a `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/azure/azure-functions-golang-worker/sdk"
    "github.com/azure/azure-functions-golang-worker/worker"
)

func main() {
    app := sdk.FunctionApp()

    // Register an HTTP trigger using familiar types
    app.HTTP("hello", hello,
        sdk.WithMethods("GET", "POST"),
        sdk.WithAuth("anonymous"),
    )

    // Start the worker
    worker.Start(app)
}

func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    name := r.URL.Query().Get("name")
    if name == "" {
        name = "Azure"
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s! Welcome to Go on Azure Functions.", name)
}
```

Run the application locally using the Core Tools:

```bash
func start
```
*Note: `func start` will automatically compile and build your Go application before starting the local Azure Functions host.*

## Trigger Model: Core Triggers vs Extension Triggers

The Go Worker organizes triggers into two tiers based on their dependency requirements:

### Core Triggers (`sdk/`)

**HTTP, Timer, CosmosDB, ServiceBus, EventHub, EventGrid, SQL**

These triggers receive data inline via gRPC — the host serializes the trigger payload (JSON documents, messages, events) into the `InvocationRequest` and the worker deserializes it into typed Go structs. They have:

- **Typed handler signatures** — e.g., `func(context.Context, []bindings.CosmosDocument) error`
- **Zero external dependencies** — only `encoding/json` needed for deserialization
- **Bounded payloads** — change feed docs, queue messages, and events are discrete, size-limited objects

```go
// Core trigger — typed, no extra imports needed
app.CosmosDB("processChanges", handler,
    sdk.WithDatabase("mydb"),
    sdk.WithContainer("mycontainer"),
    sdk.WithConnection("CosmosDBConnection"),
)

// SQL trigger — invoked with a batch of row changes captured via
// Change Tracking. See samples/sqlTrigger for the prerequisite
// ALTER DATABASE / ALTER TABLE statements.
app.SQL("productsChanged", productsChanged,
    sdk.WithTable("dbo.Products"),
    sdk.WithConnection("AzureWebJobsSqlConnectionString"),
)

// Event Hub and Service Bus expose separate, strongly typed batch methods.
app.EventHubBatch("processEvents", eventBatchHandler,
    sdk.WithEventHubName("events"),
    sdk.WithConnection("EventHubConnection"),
)

app.ServiceBusQueueBatch("processMessages", messageBatchHandler,
    sdk.WithQueueName("messages"),
    sdk.WithConnection("ServiceBusConnection"),
)
```

### Extension Triggers (`triggers/`)

**Blob** (and future Queue, Table, etc.)

These triggers provide an authenticated Azure SDK client instead of raw data. The host sends only metadata (container, blob path); the worker constructs a client scoped to the specific resource. They have:

- **SDK client injection** — handler receives e.g., `*blob.Client` ready to use
- **Isolated dependencies** — `azblob`, `azidentity` etc. live in `triggers/blob/`, activated via blank import
- **Streaming support** — user can `DownloadStream()` without buffering GBs through gRPC

```go
import _ "github.com/azure/azure-functions-golang-worker/triggers/blob" // activate extension

// Extension trigger — handler gets a live SDK client
app.Blob("processBlobTrigger", handler,
    sdk.WithPath("samples-workitems/{name}"),
    sdk.WithConnection("AzureWebJobsStorage"),
)
```

### When is each tier used?

| Criterion | Core (data passthrough) | Extension (SDK client) |
|---|---|---|
| Payload size | Bounded (KB–low MB) | Potentially unbounded (GBs) |
| External SDK needed? | No | Yes |
| Data in gRPC message? | Yes — already serialized by host | No — only metadata |
| Streaming? | Not needed | Essential |
| Handler type | Typed alias (`CosmosDBHandler`) | `any` (validated via reflection) |

This is similar to the .NET worker extensions model (`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`) but avoids over-abstracting core triggers that don't need external dependencies.

### Generic host triggers

Use `App.GenericTrigger` when a host extension supports a trigger that has no
dedicated Go registration method. No user-authored trigger package or client
factory is required.

```go
app.GenericTrigger("ProcessOrder", func(ctx context.Context, body []byte) error {
    slog.InfoContext(ctx, "order", "body", string(body))
    return nil
}, &bindings.GenericTrigger{
    Type: "queueTrigger", Name: "message", DataType: "string",
    Properties: map[string]any{
        "queueName": "orders", "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage",
    },
})
```

Text and byte slices receive the raw payload. Structs and other JSON models
are decoded into the handler's parameter type. Set `Cardinality: "many"` to
request host batching when the extension supports it, and accept a slice.
The usual invocation context and middleware still apply.

An optional typed package can translate a configuration struct into the same
descriptor and pass the original handler through. This adds defaults and
configuration checks without a separate invocation pipeline.

The compatible host extension must be installed. Generic registration does
not provide HTTP handling, SDK-client injection, Durable replay, or message
settlement. Use their existing adapters. See the
[generic trigger sample](samples/genericTriggers/README.md) for direct raw/JSON
registrations, the optional typed wrapper, metadata, batches, and an MCP tool.
Use the local checkout until a release containing this API is available.

## Goroutine safety & panic recovery

The worker recovers panics that happen **inside your handler** and reports them to the host as a failed invocation with the full Go stack trace — so they show up, diagnosable, in Application Insights.

That safety net does **not** extend to goroutines you start yourself. In Go, an unrecovered panic in *any* goroutine terminates the entire process. In an Azure Functions worker this is especially dangerous: the worker hosts multiple concurrent invocations (potentially across different functions), so **one panicking goroutine crashes every in-flight request on the worker**, not just the function that spawned it. The host sees "worker exited" and the real stack never reaches your logs.

### Propagate panics as errors: `sdk.RecoverTo`

For work that matters (processing events, calling APIs), use [`sdk.RecoverTo`](sdk/safego.go) so panics propagate as errors and the invocation fails properly — triggering retries instead of silent data loss.

**Recommended: errgroup** (no defer-ordering pitfalls — the closure's return is read after all defers run):

```go
import "golang.org/x/sync/errgroup"

func EventHubHandler(ctx context.Context, events []bindings.EventHubMessage) error {
    g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(ctx)
    for _, e := range events {
        g.Go(func() (err error) {
            defer sdk.RecoverTo(ctx, &err)
            return process(e)
        })
    }
    return g.Wait() // non-nil on panic → invocation fails → host retries
}
```

**Manual WaitGroup** — register `wg.Done` *before* `RecoverTo` so it fires *after* the error is set (defers run in LIFO order):

```go
var err error
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(1)
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()                // registered first → runs LAST
    defer sdk.RecoverTo(ctx, &err) // registered second → runs FIRST (sets err)
    doWork()
}()
wg.Wait()
return err // safe: err is set before wg.Done unblocks Wait
```

`RecoverTo` logs the full stack trace with invocation metadata (via slog + the SDK log handler) and sets `*errp` to a descriptive error. If `*errp` already holds a non-nil error, the original is preserved.

### Best-effort work: `sdk.Recover`

For genuinely best-effort goroutines where failure doesn't affect correctness (cache warming, fire-and-forget telemetry), defer [`sdk.Recover`](sdk/safego.go) to keep the worker alive without the ceremony of error propagation:

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(1)
go func() {
    defer sdk.Recover(ctx) // catches panic, logs with invocation metadata
    defer wg.Done()
    warmCache(ctx)
}()
wg.Wait()
```

> **Rule of thumb:** if a goroutine's failure should fail the invocation, use `sdk.RecoverTo`. If the goroutine is truly best-effort, `sdk.Recover` keeps the worker alive with one line.

---

## Telemetry & Observability

The worker emits structured logs and distributed traces with minimal setup.

### Structured logging

The SDK installs an [`slog`](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog) handler at package init that routes every record over the gRPC log channel back to the host. Each entry automatically carries `invocation_id`, `function_name`, and `trigger_type`, so logs in Application Insights are correlated to the right invocation without any user wiring:

```go
slog.InfoContext(ctx, "processing item", "item_id", id, "size_bytes", n)
```

The default handler honors the host's per-category log levels and the `--verbose` flag. Call `slog.SetDefault` yourself if you need a different backend.

### OpenTelemetry distributed tracing

The [`middleware/otelfunc`](middleware/otelfunc) package provides an `sdk.Middleware` that creates an internal-kind span (`function <FunctionName>`) around every invocation, extracts the host's W3C trace context so user spans correlate end-to-end, advertises the `WorkerOpenTelemetryEnabled` capability so the host stops forwarding the worker's user log records (`Function.*` categories) into its own OpenTelemetry pipeline, and force-flushes after each invocation (critical on consumption-style plans where the worker may be frozen).

The span shape is consistent across Azure Functions runtimes, so cross-runtime dashboards filter on one set of keys.

The default Resource carries:

- `cloud.provider=azure`
- `cloud.platform=azure_functions`
- `cloud.region=$REGION_NAME`
- `cloud.resource_id=/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<site>` (when `WEBSITE_OWNER_NAME` + `WEBSITE_RESOURCE_GROUP` + `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` are populated by the platform)
- `deployment.environment.name=$WEBSITE_SLOT_NAME` (default `production`)
- `service.name`
- `otel.library.version` (the SDK module's runtime version)

Per-invocation spans additionally carry:

- `process.pid`
- `faas.instance`
- `azure.functions.live_logs_session_id` (for portal live-log correlation)

The worker also emits a one-time `Go worker started` log record on cold start summarizing the SDK version, git revision, Go version, and runtime metadata. Customer queries against `message = "Go worker started"` show which build is running and whether it carries any local `replace` directive in `go.mod`.

To propagate tags to the host's parent AspNetCore activity (e.g. `tenant_id`, `user_id` your handler resolves from the request), set them on the worker invocation span — `middleware/otelfunc` auto-harvests them at end-of-invocation and forwards them on `InvocationResponse.TraceContextAttributes`:

```go
func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    span := trace.SpanFromContext(r.Context())
    span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("tenant_id", tenantOf(r)))
}
```

Works identically on gRPC-body and HTTP-streaming triggers (Flusher / SSE handlers included). Matches the dotnet-isolated worker's `Activity.AddTag(...)` propagation pattern, so customers moving between runtimes see the same shape on the receiving end.

The middleware is **opt-in**: importing only `sdk` and `worker` keeps the OTel SDK out of your binary entirely. The smallest setup just registers the middleware and sets the standard OTel env vars on your Function App:

```go
import (
    "github.com/azure/azure-functions-golang-worker/middleware/otelfunc"
)

app := sdk.FunctionApp()
app.Use(otelfunc.Middleware())
```

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.your-backend.example
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=<your_token>
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-function-app
```

`host.json` must set `"telemetryMode": "OpenTelemetry"` for the host to wire its own OpenTelemetry pipeline and honor the worker-advertised `WorkerOpenTelemetryEnabled` capability. See [`samples/otelTracing`](samples/otelTracing) for a complete working example.

For more control, build the exporters yourself and pass them as options. `WithExporter` and `WithLogExporter` can be called multiple times to fan out to several backends:

```go
import (
    "github.com/azure/azure-functions-golang-worker/middleware/otelfunc"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdouttrace"
)

otlpExp, _ := otlptracehttp.New(ctx)
debugExp, _ := stdouttrace.New(stdouttrace.WithWriter(os.Stderr))

app := sdk.FunctionApp()
app.Use(otelfunc.Middleware(
    otelfunc.WithExporter(otlpExp),
    otelfunc.WithExporter(debugExp),
    otelfunc.WithResource(
        semconv.ServiceVersion(buildVersion),
        semconv.DeploymentEnvironmentName("production"),
    ),
))
```

Inbound W3C baggage is hydrated onto `ctx` automatically — read with `baggage.FromContext(ctx)`, propagate to your downstream calls with `otelhttp.NewTransport(...)` / `otelgrpc` interceptors. See `package otelfunc` godoc for full options including `WithTracerProvider`, `WithPropagator`, custom span names, and the `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_WORKER_OPENTELEMETRY_DISABLED` kill switch.

## Custom Handlers vs First-Class Go Worker

Historically, Go was only supported on Azure Functions via "Custom Handlers" (an HTTP-based proxy pattern). This new natively supported Go Worker provides a richer experience:
1. **gRPC Integration**: The worker connects directly to the host process via an `EventStream`, reducing HTTP proxy overhead.
2. **First-class Bindings**: You no longer need to parse raw HTTP headers to read trigger/binding data; the gRPC worker deserializes the metadata and binding data directly into your Go objects.
3. **No configurations:** Function endpoints are discovered cleanly in code without `function.json`.
